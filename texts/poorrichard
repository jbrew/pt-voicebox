No wood without bark.  395.* No workman without tools, nor lawyer without fools, can live by their rules.  396. Observe all men; thyself most.  397. Observe old Vellum; he praises for-  mer times, as if he'd a mind to sell 'em.  398. Of learned fools I have seen ten times ten ; of unlearned wise men I have seen a hundred.  399. O Lazy-bones ! Dost thou think God would have given thee arms and legs, if he had not design'd thou should'st use them.  400. Old boys have their playthings as well as young ones; the difference is only in the price.    POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK. 41  401. Old young and old long.  402.* One good, husband is worth two good wives; for the scarcer things are the more they're valued.  403. One may be more cunning than an- other, but not more cunning than everybody else.  404.* One mend-fault is worth two find- faults, but one find-fault is better than two make-faults.  405. One to-day is worth two to-mor- rows.  406.* Onions can make ev'n heirs and widows weep.  407.* Pain wastes the body; pleasures the understanding.  408. Pardoning the bad, is injuring the good.  409. Patience in market, is worth pounds  in a year.  410. Pay what you owe, and you'll know what's your own.  411. Philosophy as well as foppery often  changes fashion.  412.

Poor Dick eats like a well man, and  drinks like a sick.  415. Poor Plain Dealing! Dead without  issue.  416.* Poverty, poetry, and new titles of honor, make men ridiculous.  417.* Poverty wants some things, luxury many things, avarice all things.  418. Praise to the undeserving is severe satire.  419. Pray, don't burn my house to roast your eggs.  420. Prayers and provender hinder no journey.  421. Presumption first blinds a man, then  sets him a running.  422. Pretty and witty, will wound if they hit ye.  423.* Pride and the gout are seldom cur'd throughout.  424. Pride breakfasted with plenty, dined with poverty, supped with infamy.  425. Pride dines upon vanity, sups on contempt.  426. Pride is as loud a beggar as want, and a great deal more saucy.    POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK. 48  427. Pride gets into the coach, and shame  mounts behind.  428. Proclaim not all thou knowest, all thou owest, all thou hast, nor all thou canst.  429. Prodigality of time, produces pov- erty of mind as well as of estate.  430. Promises may get thee friends, but non-performance will turn them in- to enemies.  431.* Proud modern learning despises the ancient. School-men are now laughed at by school-boys.  432. Quarrels never could last long, if on one side only lay the wrong.  433. Rather go to bed supperless, than run in debt for a breakfast.  434.* Reading makes a full man, medita- tion a profound man, discourse a clear man.  435. Read much, but not many books.  436.* Retirement does not always secure virtue ; Lot was upright in the city, wicked in the mountain.  437. Rob not for burnt offerings.  438.* Rob not God, nor the poor, lest thou ruin thyself; the eagle snatched a coal from the altar, but it fired her nest.    44 POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK.  439. Samson with his strong body, had  a weak head, or he would not have laid in a harlot's lap.  440.

Silks and satins put out the kitchen fire.  445. Since thou art not sure of a minute,  throw not away an hour.  446.* Singularity in the right, hath ruined many; happy those who are convinced of the general opinion.  447. Sleep without supping, and you'll  rise without owing for it.  448. Sloth and silence are a fool's vir- tues.  449.* Sloth (like rust) consumes faster than labor wears. The used key is always bright.  450. Snowy winter, a plentiful harvest.    POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK. 45  451.* Some are justly laughed at for keeping their money foolishly, others for spending it idly ; he is the greatest fool that lays it out in a purchase of repentance.  452. Some are weatherwise, some are otherwise.  453. Some make conscience of wearing a hat in the church, who make none of robbing the altar.  454. Sorrow is good for nothing but sin.  455. Spare and have is better than spend and crave.  456.* Speak and speed; the close mouth catches no flies.  457. Speak little, do much.  458.* Speak with contempt of none, from slave to king; the meanest bee hath, and will use, a sting.  459. Strange! that a man who has wit  enough to write a satire, should have folly enough to publish it.  460. Strange, that he who lives by shifts, can seldom shift himself.  461.* Strive to be the greatest man in your country, and you may be dis- appointed ; strive to be the best, and you may succeed ; he may well win the race that runs by himself.    46 POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK.  462. Success has ruin'd many a man.  463.* Sudden power is apt to be insolent, sudden liberty saucy; that behaves best which has grown gradually.  464. Suspicion may be no fault, but showing it may be a great one.  465.* Take counsel in wine, but resolve afterwards in water.  466. Take courage, mortal; death can't  banish thee out of the universe.  467. Take heed of the vinegar of sweet  wine, and the anger of good-nature.  468. Take this remark from Richard, poor and lame, whatever is begun in anger, ends in shame.  469.* Talking against religion is un- chaining a tiger; the beast let loose may worry his deliverer.  470.* Tart words make no friends; a spoonful of honey will catch more flies than a gallon of s vinegar.  471. Teach your child to hold his tongue, he'll learn fast enough to speak.  472.* Tell a miser he's rich, and a woman she's old, you'll get no money of one, nor kindness of t'other.  473. Tell me my faults, and mend your own.    POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK. 4T  474. The absent are never without fault, nor the present without excuse.  475.* The ancients tell us what is best, but we must learn of the moderns what is fittest.  476. The bell calls others to church, but  itself never minds the sermon.  477. The bird that sits, is easily shot.  478. The brave and the wise can both pity and excuse, when cowards and fools shew no mercy.  479.* The busy man has few idle visitors ; to the boiling pot the flies come not.  480. The cat in gloves catches no mice.  481. The creditors are a superstitious  sect, great observers of set days and times.  482.* The cunning man steals a horse, the wise man lets him alone.  493. The devil sweetens poison with honey.  484. The discontented man finds no easy  chair.  485. The doors of wisdom are never shut.  486. The end of passion is the beginning  of repentance.  487.* The excellency of hogs is fatness, of men virtue.    48 POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK.  488. The eye of a master, will do more work than his hand.  489. The family of fools is ancient.  490. The favor of tLe great is no in-  heritance.  491. The generous mind least regards  money, and yet most feels the want of it.  492. The golden age never was the pres-  ent age.  493. The good pay-master is lord of an-  other man's purse.  494. The good or ill hap of a good or ill life, is the good or ill choice of a good or ill wife.  495.* The heart of the fool is in his mouth, but the mouth of the wise man is in his heart.  496. The heathens when they dy'd, went to bed without a candle.  497.* The honest man takes pains, and then enjoys pleasures; the knave takes pleasures, and then suffers pains.  498.* The honey is sweet, but the bee has a sting.  499. The horse thinks one thing, and he that saddles him another.    POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK. 49  500. The idle man is the devil's hireling;  whose livery is rags, whose diet and wages are famine and diseases.  501. The king's cheese is half wasted in  parings; but no matter, 'tis made of the people's milk.  502. The learned fool writes his nonsense  in better language than the un- learned ; but still 'tis nonsense.  503.* The magistrate should obey the laws, the people should obey the magistrate.  504. The master's eye wil do more work  than both his hands.  505. The miser's cheese is wholesom'st.  506. The most exquisite folly is made of  wisdom spun too fine.  507. The muses love the morning.  508. The nearest way to come to glory,  is to do that for conscience which we do for glory.  509. The noblest question in the world is,  what good may I do in it?  510.* The old man has given all to his son ; O fool ! to undress thyself be- fore thou art going to bed.  511.* The painful preacher, like a candle bright, consumes himself in giving others light.    60 POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK.  512. The poor have little, beggars none, the rich too much, enough not one.  513.* The poor man must walk to get meat for his stomach, the rich man to get a stomach to his meat.  514. The prodigal generally does more injustice than the covetous.  515.* The proof of gold is fire; the proof of woman, gold; the proof of man, a woman.  516. The proud hate pride in others.  517. There are lazy minds as well as lazy  bodies.  518. There are no fools so troublesome as  those that have wit.  519.* There are no ugly loves, nor hand- some prisons.  520. There are three faithful friends, an old wife, an old dog, and ready money.  521.* There are three things extremely hard, steel, a diamond and to know one's self.  522. There is neither honor nor gain got  in dealing with a villian.  523. There is no little enemy.  524. There is no man so bad but he se-  cretly respects the good.    POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK. 61  525. There is much difference between  imitating a good man, and counter- feiting him.  526. There's a time to wink as well as to  see.  527.

There's small revenge in words, but  words may be greatly revenged.  531. There was never a good knife made  of bad steel.  532. They who have nothing to trouble  them, will be troubled at nothing.  533.* The rivers and bad governments, the lightest things swim at top.  534. The rotten apple spoils his com-  panion.  535. The royal crown cures not the head- ache.  536. The same man cannot be both friend  and flatterer.  537. The sleeping fox catches no poultry.  Up! up!    52 POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK.  538. The second vice is lying; the first is  running in debt.  539. The sting of a reproach is the truth  of it.  540. The sun never repents of the good  he does, nor does he ever demand a recompence.  541. The things which hurt, instruct.  542. The tongue is ever turning to the  aching tooth.  543. The tongue offends, and the ears get  the cuffing.  544. The too obliging temper is evermore  disobliging itself.  545. The way to be safe, is never to be  secure.  546.* The way to see by faith, is to shut the Eye of Reason. The morning daylight appears plainer when you put out your candle.  547. The wise man draws more advan-  tage from his enemies, than the fool from his friends.  548. The worst wheel of the cart makes  the most noise.  549.* The wolf sheds his coat once a year, his disposition never.    POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK. 58  550.* Think of three things, whence you came, where you are going, and to whom you must account.  551. Thirst after desert, not reward.  552.* Tho' modesty is a virtue, bashful- ness is a vice.  553. Those that have much business  must have much pardon.  554. Those who are fear'd, are hated.  555. Those who in quarrels interpose,  must often wipe a bloody nose.  556. Tho' the mastiff be gentle, yet bite  him not by the lip.  557. Thou canst not joke an enemy into  a friend; but thou may'st a friend into an enemy.  558. Three good meals a day is bad liv-  ing.  559. Three may keep a secret, if two of  them are dead.  560.* Three things are men most likely to be cheated in, a horse, a wig, and a wife.  561.* Tim and his handsaw are good in their place, tho' not fit for preaching or shaving a face.  562. Time enough always proves little enough.    54 POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK.  563. Time is an herb that cures all dis- eases.  564.* Tim was so learned, that he could name a horse in nine languages. So ignorant, that he bought a cow to ride on.  565.* 'Tis against some men's principle to pay interest, and seems against others' interest to pay the principal.  566.

You ought to be an honor to your family.  568.* 'Tis a strange forest that has no rotten wood in it, and a strange kin- dred that all are good in it.  569. 'Tis better leave for an enemy at  one's d^ath, than beg of a friend in one's life.  570. J Tis easier to build two chimneys,  than maintain one in fuel.  571. 'Tis easier to prevent bad habits  tnan to break them.  572. 'Tis easy to see, hard to foresee.  573. 'Tis easier to suppress the first de-  sire, than to satisfy all that follow it.    POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK. 55  574. 'Tis great confidence in a friend to  tell him your faults, greater to tell him his.  575. 'Tis hard (but glorious) to be poor and lionest.  576.* 'Tis less discredit to abridge petty charges, than to stoop to petty get- tings.  577. Tis not a holiday that's not kept holy.  578. 'Tis a well spent penny that saves a  groat.  579. To bear other people's afflictions,  every one has courage enough, and to spare.  580.* To be intimate with a foolish friend, is like going to bed with a razor.  581.* To be proud of knowledge, is to be blind with light; to be proud of virtue, is to poison yourself with the antidote.  582. To-day is yesterday's pupil.  583.* To err is human, to repent divine, to persist devilish.  584. To lengthen thy life, lessen thy meals.    56 POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK.  585.

Virtue and a trade, are a child's best portion.  599. Virtue and happiness are mother  and daughter.  600.* Virtue may not always make a face handsome, but vice will certainly make it ugly.  601.* Visits should be short, like a win- ter's day; lest you're too trouble- some hasten away.  602.* Visit your aunt, but not every day ; and call at your brother's, but not every night.  603. Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge.  604. Wars bring scars.  605.* We are not so sensible of the great- est health as of the least sickness.  606.

Well done is better than well said.  610. Well done, is twice done.  611. We may give advice, but we cannot  give conduct.    58 POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK.  612.* What is a butterfly at best? He's but a caterpillar dressed, the gaudy fop's his picture just.  613.* What's given shines, what's re- ceiv'd is rusty.  614. What signifies knowing the names,  if you know not the nature of things.  615. What signifies your patience, if you  can't find it when you want it.  616.* What's proper is becoming; see the blacksmith with his white silk apron.  617. What you would seem to be, be really.  618. When a friend deals with a friend,  let the bargain be clear and well penn'd, that they may continue friends to the end.  619.* When befriended, remember it; when you befriend, forget it.  620.* When death puts out your flame, the snuff will tell, if we were wax or tallow by the smell.  621. When knaves betray each other, one can scarce be blamed or the other pitied.    POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK. 6  622.* When knaves fall out, honest men get their goods; when priests dis- pute, we come at the truth.  623. When out of favor, none know thee ;  when in, thou dcst not know thy- self.  624. When prosperity was well mounted,  she let go the bridle, and soon came tumbling out of the saddle.  625.

Where there's no law, there's no  bread.  637.* Where there is hunger, law is not regarded; and where law is not re- garded, there will be hunger.  638. Where there's marriage without love, there will be love without marriage.  639.

Wish not so much to live long as to  live well.  643. Without justice courage is weak.  644. With the old almanack and the old year, leave thy old vice, tho' ever so dear.  645. Who dainties love, shall beggars  prove.    POOR RICHARD'S ALMANACK. 61  646. Who has deceived thee so oft as thyself?  647. Who is powerful? He that governs  his passions.  648. Who is rich ? He that is content.  649. Who is rich? He that rejoices in  his portion.  650. Who is strong? He that can con-  quer his bad habits.  651. Who is wise? He that learns from every one.  652.

Why does the blind man's wife paint herself?  663.* You can bear your own faults, and why not a fault in your wife.  664. You may be too cunning for one,out  not for all.  665. You may delay, but time will not.  666. You may give a man an office, but  you cannot give him discretion.  667. You may talk too much on the best  subjects.  668. You may sometimes be much in the  wrong, in owning your being in the right.  659.* Youth is pert and positive, age modest and doubting; so ears of corn when young and light, stand bolt upright, but hang their heads when weighty, full, and ripe.  670.* You will be careful, if you are wise ; how you touch men's religion, or credit, or eyes.
